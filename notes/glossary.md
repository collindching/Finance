# Finance terms

## Alpha

The active return on investment, compared to a market index. An alpha of 1% means an investment's returns beat the market during that same period by 1%. A negative alpha means the investment underperforms the market.


## Beta

Measure of systematic risk of an investment, also known as volatility. 

## Sharpe ratio

Characterizes how well an asset's return compensate the investor for risk taken on. An asset that that has a higher Sharpe ratio provides a better return for the same risk. Defining $R_P$ as portfolio return and $R_f$ as theoretical risk-free return ($\text{treasury bonds} - \text{inflation rate}$), 

$$R_P - R_f = \alpha + \beta(R_m - R_f)$$

$$\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_P - R_f}{\sigma_P}$$

In other words...

$$\frac{\text{average return} - \text{risk-free return}}{\text{standard deviation of investment returns}}$$

## PE Ratio

The price-to-earnings ratio indicate the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company in order to receive one dollar of that companyâ€™s earnings. 

The P/E is sometimes referred to as the price multiple because it shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. 

A P/E of 20x indicates that an investor is willing to pay \$20 for \$1 of current earnings

## PEG Ratio

Companies that have higher growth rates have higher P/E ratios, making them seem overvalued. The PEG ratio allows one to factor future growth into price/earnings analysis. 

The formula is $\text{PEG} = \frac{\text{Price/Earnings}}{\text{Expected Annual EPS Growth}}$. Growth rate here represents annual growth. 

A PEG ratio value of 1 represents perfect balance between a company's market value and projected earnings growth. 

PEG ratios higher than 1 are generally unfavorable and suggest that a stock is overvalued. Ratios below 1 indicate that a stock is undervalued. Generally, lower is better.
