# Developing Trading Models

## Model purpose

A solid model trades a real market phenomenon, aiming for a certain type of return profile. 

A proper trading model needs to start off with a theory about market behavior. It needs to have a clearly stated purpose in what market phenomenon it's trading.

Two ways to go about this:

1. Start off with a theory, and formulate mathematical rules to test hypothesis 
2. Start off with a business need, as stipulated by firm

## Rules and variations

Aim for as few rules and as few variations as possible. Robust trading models that work over the long-run tend to be simple.

Skip optimization, but makes variations of your rules using reasonable and sensible numbers.
